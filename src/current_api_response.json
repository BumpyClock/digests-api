Following the reveal of its floating, glowing Hotaru turntable last month, the company has announced its new AT-LPA2 featuring a chassis and platter made from transparent acrylic. With electronics like its power supply and playback controls packed into a separate unit that can be kept out of sight, the turntable is a reminder that transparent tech can still look modern and sleek.\n\nThe AT-LPA2 features a similar design to the Audio-Technica AT-LP2022 turntable that was released in January 2023 to help commemorate the company’s 60th anniversary. The previous version was limited to just 3,000 units made available worldwide and sold for $1,200. The new AT-LPA2 is available starting today, and while its rollout won’t be as limited, it now costs $2,000.\n\nThe base of the turntable is made from a 30mm thick slab of high-density transparent acrylic, while the spinning platter atop is made from the same material that’s 20mm thick. It not only makes for a striking design, but acrylic is also an effective material for dampening vibrations which improves playback performance and helps keep the turntable operating quietly.\n\nDirect drive turntables, in which the spinning platter is part of the electric motor, offer superior performance over those that use a separate motor connected with a belt. But in this case, a belt drive actually serves to enhance the aesthetics of the AT-LPA2. To ensure accurate playback, Audio-Technica includes an optical sensor that monitors the platter’s rotation so it maintains a constant speed of either 33 1/3 or 45rpm.\n\nThe company redesigned the tone arm included with the limited edition model, but it’s still made from carbon fiber to help reduce its weight and includes interchangeable counterweights that can be added and removed to help keep the arm balanced with different cartridges.\n\nTo help keep the turntable’s chassis as transparent as possible, playback controls and other buttons are included on a separate unit that also houses the power supply. That approach not only lets you position the control unit out of sight since it’s not transparent and doesn’t match the AT-LPA2’s aesthetic, Audio-Technica says it also isolates the turntable’s audio components from power supply noise “resulting in a cleaner, more accurate sound.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","created":"2025-05-15T12:23:32-04:00","content_encoded":"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"The Audio-Technica transparent AT-LPA2 turntable against a white background.\" data-caption=\"You’ll want to make sure to regularly dust underneath Audio-Technica’s new transparent turntable, too. | Image: Audio-Technica\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Audio-Technica\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/audiotechnica_turntable1.jpg?quality=90\u0026#038;strip=all\u0026#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" /\u003e\n\t\u003cfigcaption\u003eYou’ll want to make sure to regularly dust underneath Audio-Technica’s new transparent turntable, too. | Image: Audio-Technica\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003eAudio-Technica’s engineers are seemingly working overtime to elevate the design of the record player.

Apple has spent years gradually adding new features that work best — and sometimes only work at all — within the company’s walled garden. These convenient tricks include audio sharing, automatic switching between Apple’s various devices, Apple TV integration, and more. \n\nThere are four AirPods models to choose from, each with a distinct appeal and upside. You likely already know whether you’re more interested in earbuds or over-ear headphones, so that’s the first divide. In the case of headphones, your only choice is the AirPods Max. But in the earbuds category, Apple has three options: the AirPods Pro, AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation, and the plain old AirPods 4. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best AirPods overallThe best if you don’t find ear tips comfortableThe best for those who prefer headphones\n\n\nThe best AirPods overall\n\nIf you want the earbuds that guarantee you’ll get the latest and greatest software features from Apple, the second-generation AirPods Pro should be at the top of your list. They offer the whole gamut of ecosystem exclusives. And if you’re the type of person to misplace things, you’ll be thankful that the earbuds’ case has a U1 chip for pinpoint location finding. So whenever they go missing, you can track right where they are in the room using Apple’s Find My app.\n\nThe AirPods Pro deliver noise cancellation that’s effective at tamping down the volume of your surroundings in all but the most hectic environments. Their sound quality is on another level compared to the regular AirPods — helped in no small part by the in-ear seal you get from their silicone ear tips. \n\nIn 2024, Apple introduced three major hearing health features, including a hearing test, automatic hearing protection, and the option to use the AirPods Pro as clinical-grade hearing aids if you have mild or moderate hearing loss. No other AirPods (including the AirPods Max) offer this functionality, so it definitely sets the Pros apart. And the same can be said of their volume controls; you just swipe on the stems to raise or lower the loudness of your music, which is a handy advantage that the similar-looking AirPods 4 lack. \n\nRead our full AirPods Pro 2 review.\n\nThe best if you don’t find ear tips comfortable\n\nBut not everyone likes the way ear tips feel. Even with venting and the other measures Apple has taken to improve comfort and reduce that clogged-up sensation, some people just prefer the regular, one-size-fits-most AirPods. Their open design means you’re never cut off from the outside world. The AirPods Pro have an impressive transparency mode, but the AirPods 4 don’t need to pipe in your surroundings; you can always hear what’s happening around you.\n\nApple sells two versions of the AirPods 4. No matter which you choose, you’ll get the same sound quality, microphone performance on voice calls, and IP54 water resistance. (The latter also applies to the AirPods Pro.) The more expensive pair features active noise cancellation and a more advanced charging case. You might be surprised by how well the noise cancellation works even with an unsealed design; it reduces office ambience and annoying hums, but louder sounds and voices still cut through the ANC. As for the case, the pricier AirPods 4 include wireless charging and Find My integration.\n\nIf you’re really interested in noise-canceling earbuds, you should consider saving a bit more and stepping up to the AirPods Pro 2. They offer much better audio quality, stronger ANC, and a better experience. I’d only steer you to the noise-canceling AirPods 4 if you’re really opposed to ear tips. \n\nRead my full AirPods 4 review.\n\nThe best for those who prefer headphones\n\nI’ve gone back and forth recommending Apple’s $549 AirPods Max over the last few years. They have a standout design, but the good looks and premium feel come at the cost of weight. These headphones are considerably heavier than most competitors and can get fatiguing over extended use. But Apple has also made smart choices: the fabric ear cups on the AirPods Max are much more pleasant in warm weather than the pleather you’ll find on Bose and Sony products, and won’t get your ears sweaty. \n\nThe AirPods Max provide impressive noise cancellation, and the transparency mode is clearer and more natural-sounding than any other set of headphones on the market. As for sound, Apple’s headphones have a pleasant sound signature that works well across a wide range of genres. They’re easy to listen to with an impressive soundstage for closed-back headphones. \n\nYou lose some features — like conversation awareness and adaptive audio — that are included on the AirPods Pro; this is a side effect of the AirPods Max using Apple’s older H1 chip. But the company recently added lossless audio over USB-C, meaning these headphones offer the richest audio fidelity of the whole lineup. \n\nRead my full AirPods Max (Lightning) review.\n\n\nHow we test AirPods\n\n\n\nWe spend dozens of hours using AirPods products for our initial reviews, and that testing extends for weeks and months afterward. That’s where we assess sound quality, mic performance, and overall reliability. Where applicable, we try the active noise cancellation in a wide range of different environments and have put the hearing protection of the AirPods Pro through the paces at concerts. We also closely examine ecosystem benefits and how the AirPods and Apple’s other products work together.\n\n\nUpdate, May 15th: Adjusted prices and availability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","created":"2025-05-15T14:00:00-04:00","content_encoded":"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257689_Airpod_buying_guide_CVirginia.jpg?quality=90\u0026#038;strip=all\u0026#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" /\u003e\n\t\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003eWhether you’re buying your first pair of AirPods or replacing a well-used older pair, it’s easy to understand why so many iPhone owners prefer Apple’s earbuds and headphones over other options.

Continuing the Trump administration’s assault on federal water and energy efficiency programs, the department announced today what it’s calling its “largest deregulatory effort in history.” \n\nThe agency is trying to rollback 47 regulations it says are “burdensome and costly,” including more than a dozen efficiency standards for appliances and battery chargers. The proposed rules target the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), which contains an anti-backsliding provision — and that the Trump administration is seemingly trying to bypass.\n\n“If this attack on consumers succeeds, President Trump would be raising costs dramatically for families as manufacturers dump energy- and water-wasting products into the market. Fortunately, it’s patently illegal, so hold your horses,” Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said in a press statement released today.\n\n“Fortunately, it’s patently illegal, so hold your horses.”\n\nThe Energy Department didn’t immediately respond to a press inquiry from The Verge asking why it believes its proposals do not violate EPCA, which passed Congress in 1975 and had the anti-backsliding provision added in 1987. However, drafts of proposed rules on the Federal Register’s website say that it wants to return standards to previous limits set by Congress. \n\nIn some cases, doing so could eliminate decades of energy and water saving standards, deLaski tells The Verge. A proposed rule for commercial clothes washers, for instance, would bring water conservation standards back to a “statutory baseline” set in 2007. Other rules target microwave ovens, conventional ovens, dish washers, faucets, portable air conditioners, and more. \n\nThe law’s anti-backsliding provision stipulates that the energy secretary can’t amend a standard in a way that “increases the maximum allowable energy use” or “decreases the minimum required energy efficiency” of a covered product. In other words, the agency can’t issue rules that are weaker than they were before. In many cases, the Energy Department has updated standards initially set by Congress as more efficient technologies became available — which it’s required to do by law if it is “economically justified.”\n\nThe rules proposed today attempt to go back to limits set by Congress years ago, undoing tougher standards set more recently. The Energy Department is also attempting to get rid of standards altogether in cases where limits weren’t explicitly set in law by Congress. \n\nIn the proposed rule for commercial clothes washers, the agency argues that the anti-backsliding provision applies to energy efficiency but not water standards. “Water use has nothing to do with the energy consumed by a clothes washer. Therefore, the anti-backsliding provision does not apply,” it says. That’s a misleading argument, according to energy experts at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). Technologies that use less hot water also use less energy, since it takes energy to heat up that water.\n\nThe agency still needs to open up its rules for public comment before attempting to finalize them, and is likely to face legal challenges. Courts have previously weighed in on the strength of the anti-backsliding provision. A 2004 decision from a federal appeals court in a suit filed by NRDC, several states, and other plaintiffs says EPCA “unambiguously” constrains the Energy Department’s ability to weaken efficiency standards once they are published as final rules in the Federal Register.\n\n“We’re seeing the wholesale abandonment of a dozen-plus energy efficiency standards without any justification, and that absolutely violates the anti-backsliding provision,” says Kit Kennedy, who was one of the attorneys in the 2004 case and is currently a managing director at the NRDC.\n\nThe move follows a presidential memorandum Trump signed on Friday that takes aim at water use rules and related energy efficiency standards, as well as news that the Environmental Protection Agency plans to wind down the Energy Star program.\n\nExperts warn that the proposed rules could lead to higher utility bills for consumers. While a program like Energy Star can help people choose more efficient appliances, standards the Trump administration is now targeting are supposed to ensure that more efficient technologies are accessible to anyone regardless of what they can afford to purchase. \n\n“Appliance energy efficiency standards have been a great success. They save households on their electricity bills every month,” Michael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University says in an email to The Verge. “Refrigerators are just as cold and just as large as they ever were but they are now much cheaper to run.”\n\nUpdate, May 14th: This post has been updated with more information about the water and energy use of clothes washers and the 2004 lawsuit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","created":"2025-05-14T13:44:27-04:00","content_encoded":"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25334825/STK466_ELECTION_2024_CVirginia_E.jpg?quality=90\u0026#038;strip=all\u0026#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" /\u003e\n\t\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003eThe US Energy Department says it’s rolling back long-standing efficiency standards for appliances, which advocates are calling a clear violation of the law. Continuing the Trump administration’s assault on federal water and energy efficiency programs, the department announced today what it’s calling its \u003ca href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-slashes-47-burdensome-and-costly-regulations-delivering-first-milestone\"\u003e“largest deregulatory effort in history\u003c/a\u003e.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003eThe agency is trying to \u003ca href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/doe-unveils-sweeping-deregulatory-plan/\"\u003erollback 47 regulations\u003c/a\u003e it says are “burdensome and costly,” including more than a dozen efficiency standards for appliances and battery chargers. The proposed rules target the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), which contains an \u003ca href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47038\"\u003eanti-backsliding provision\u003c/a\u003e — and that the Trump administration is seemingly trying to bypass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003e“If this attack on consumers succeeds, President Trump would be raising costs dramatically for families as manufacturers dump energy- and water-wasting products into the market.

However, drafts of proposed rules \u003ca href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/energy-department\"\u003eon the Federal Register’s website\u003c/a\u003e say that it wants to return standards to previous limits set by Congress.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003eIn some cases, doing so could eliminate decades of energy and water saving standards, deLaski tells \u003cem\u003eThe Verge\u003c/em\u003e. A \u003ca href=\"https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-08599.pdf\"\u003eproposed rule for commercial clothes washers\u003c/a\u003e, for instance, would bring water conservation standards back to a “statutory baseline” set in 2007. Other rules target microwave ovens, conventional ovens, dish washers, faucets, portable air conditioners, and more.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003eThe law’s anti-backsliding provision \u003ca href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47038\"\u003estipulates\u003c/a\u003e that the energy secretary can’t amend a standard in a way that \u003ca href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/6295\"\u003e“increases the maximum allowable energy use” or “decreases the minimum required energy efficiency”\u003c/a\u003e of a covered product. In other words, the agency can’t issue rules that are weaker than they were before. In many cases, the Energy Department has updated standards initially set by Congress as more efficient technologies became available — which it’s required to do by law if it is “economically justified.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003eThe rules proposed today attempt to go back to limits set by Congress years ago, undoing tougher standards set more recently. The Energy Department is also attempting to get rid of standards altogether in cases where limits weren’t explicitly set in law by Congress.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003eIn the proposed rule for commercial clothes washers, the agency argues that the anti-backsliding provision applies to energy efficiency but not \u003cem\u003ewater\u003c/em\u003e standards. “Water use has nothing to do with the energy consumed by a clothes washer. Therefore, the anti-backsliding provision does not apply,” \u003ca href=\"https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-08599.pdf\"\u003eit says\u003c/a\u003e. That\u0026#8217;s a misleading argument, according to energy experts at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). Technologies that use less hot water also use less energy, since it takes energy to heat up that water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003eThe agency still needs to open up its rules for public comment before attempting to finalize them, and is likely to face legal challenges.

In its previously leaked, now-public blog post, Google says that up to 87 percent of 18–24-year-olds prefer expressive design like the one the company is debuting today.

The front-wheel drive bZ with 74.7 kWh battery will be able to travel an estimated 314 miles on a single charge, while a 57.7 kWh battery option for the front-wheel drive version will get just 236 miles. Toyota said it would announce prices closer to the date when the new bZ arrives at dealerships, which is expected later this year. \n\nAnd speaking of, another welcome upgrade is the inclusion of Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS), which means the Toyota bZ will be able to power up at any available Tesla Supercharger station. \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nCharging was always a major challenge for the bZ4X, so its nice to see Toyota taking those criticisms to heart. The automaker is also adding Plug and Charge capability, meaning the bZ will be able to pull up to any third-party charging station, plug in, and the driver’s account will be automatically billed without any apps to sign up for or QR codes to scan. \n\nThe bZ4X has always been kind of a sleeper hit for Toyota. After a slow start, sales of the EV shot up late last year and early this year, thanks in part to discounts and lease deals. Toyota said it sold 5,610 bZ4Xs in the first quarter of 2025, compared to only 1,897 in Q1 2024. \n\nThe bZ4X has always been kind of a sleeper hit for Toyota\n\nThe new 2026 bZ will be more of a mover in other ways for Toyota. The automaker is boosting the horsepower by up to 50 percent to 338 combined system net hp in the all-wheel drive model. This was achieved by including silicon carbide semiconductors in the motors for improved power delivery. The bZ can now accelerate from 0–60mph in 4.9 seconds.\n\nThe exterior design is now a lot cleaner and approachable. Gone are the black wheel arches, replaced with panels that match the vehicle’s paint color for a more cohesive look. The interior has also been updated with a new center console and a new instrument panel, with a larger 14-inch center touchscreen. And Apple CarPlay and Android Auto can be used wirelessly. \n\nThe new bZ is built on the same E-TNGA platform that undergirds the bZ4X, the Lexus RZ 450e, and the Subaru Solterra.

The groundwork is necessary for a future envisioned by Microsoft whereby automated AI agents assist their human companions. \n\nIntroduced by Anthropic late last year, MCP is an open-source standard that’s often referred to as the “USB-C port of AI” apps. Just as USB-C connects devices from many manufacturers to a variety of peripherals, developers can use MCP to quickly let their AI apps or agents talk to other apps, web services, or now even parts of Windows. Microsoft’s embrace of this protocol is a big part of its ambitions to reshape Windows and make it ready for a world of AI agents to be able to connect to apps and services in ways that haven’t been possible before.\n\n“We want Windows as a platform to be able to evolve to a place where we think agents are a part of the workload on the operating system, and agents are a part of how customers interact with their apps and devices on an ongoing basis,” says Windows chief Pavan Davuluri in an interview with The Verge.\n\nMicrosoft is supporting MCP in a big way inside Windows, alongside even broader efforts to power what it calls the agentic web. To evolve Windows to this agentic world that Microsoft envisions, the company is introducing some new developer capabilities to enable this MCP framework for AI agents to expose key Windows functionality that AI agents will be able to access.\n\nAn MCP registry on Windows will act as the secure, trustworthy source for all MCP servers that AI agents will be able to access. “Agents can discover the installed MCP servers on client devices via the MCP registry for Windows, leverage their expertise, and offer meaningful value to end users,” says Davuluri. MCP servers will be able to access things like the Windows File System, windowing, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux.\n\nIn a demo during a briefing for Microsoft’s MCP in Windows announcement, the company showed me an early preview of how Perplexity on Windows could leverage MCP capabilities. Instead of having to manually select folders of documents, Perplexity can simply query the MCP registry to find a Windows file system MCP server to connect to. This allows Perplexity to perform file searches on behalf of a user in a more natural way, so you could simply say “find all the files related to my vacation in my documents folder,” instead of having to add this folder or the documents manually.\n\nYou could imagine how a world of MCP servers and hosts inside Windows might eventually open the operating system up to a lot more automated app features, especially for querying data from the web inside apps like Excel. We’re also starting to see Microsoft make parts of Windows AI-powered through AI agents. Copilot Plus PCs will soon have access to an AI agent settings interface, which lets you control system settings using natural language queries.\n\nThis type of MCP functionality also opens Windows up to a world of new attack methods from malicious actors. The security risks of MCP have been well documented in recent months, with warnings of potential token theft, server compromises, and prompt injection attacks. Microsoft is well aware of the security risks of embracing MCP at such an early stage, so the company is only making a preview available to select developers to help work on its feature set and secure it fully.\n\n“I think we have a solid set of foundations and more importantly a solid architecture that gives us all the tools to start, to do this securely,” explains David Weston, vice president of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft, in an interview with The Verge. “We’re going to put security first, and ultimately we’re considering large language models as untrusted, as they can be trained on untrusted data and they can have cross-prompt injection.”\n\nIn the demo Microsoft showed me of MCP working in Windows, there were also early security prompts to let these AI apps access MCP capabilities. “Just like a web app asks for your location, you’re in control of what you share, and we want to make sure that’s intentional,” says Weston.\n\nThis is all early work from Microsoft right now, but the demo did remind me a little of Windows Vista’s UAC prompts that would pop up whenever you needed admin permissions to do things in Windows. Those became very annoying and a subject of mocking ads from Apple. Getting these prompts right will be key for Microsoft here, as it has to balance security and the convenience of using these AI agents and apps. I sure don’t want a repeat of UAC or even Apple’s copy-paste prompts that are highly irritating in iOS right now.\n\nMicrosoft is also committing to a variety of MCP security controls that Weston outlines in a blog post today, alongside some security requirements in order for MCP servers to appear in Microsoft’s official list, or registry. “These will prevent classes of attack like tool poisoning while also creating an open and diverseecosystem of MCP servers,” says Weston. “More information on these requirements will be available when thedeveloper preview is released.”\n\nAlongside this big MCP push, Microsoft is also positioning its own AI platform inside Windows as the rebranded Windows AI Foundry. It integrates models from Foundry Local and other catalogs like, Ollama and Nvidia NIMs, and is designed to allow developers to tap into models available on Copilot Plus PCs, or to bring their own models through Windows ML.\n\nWindows ML should make it a lot easier for developers to deploy their apps “without needing to packageML runtimes, hardware execution providers, or drivers with their app,” according to Davuluri. Microsoft is working closely with AMD, Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm on its Windows AI Foundry effort.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","created":"2025-05-19T12:00:00-04:00","content_encoded":"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/STK109_WINDOWS_B.jpg?quality=90\u0026#038;strip=all\u0026#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" /\u003e\n\t\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003eMicrosoft launched its Copilot Plus PC and Windows AI efforts last year, and now it’s going a step further today with native Model Context Protocol (MCP) in Windows and the launch of the Windows AI Foundry.

Reminiscent of the Nintendo Switch Online classic games library, the collection includes Pitfall, Grand Prix, and more than 50 other Activision titles from the 1980s and 1990s. It’s not as many titles as the 1,300 retro games that Antstream, Microsoft’s partner in the offering, has available on its streaming service, but it won’t cost Game Pass subscribers any extra.\n\nRetro Classics, which Microsoft writes is part of its “commitment to game preservation and backwards compatibility,” is available on Xbox consoles, PC, or via Xbox cloud gaming on compatible devices like some LG and Samsung smart TVs and the Meta Quest headset. Other games included in the collection include Cosmic Ark, MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat, and Atlantis.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on screenshots, it looks like the collection will include titles from the original PlayStation, the SNES, MS-DOS, and more.

Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 dealsThe best Apple Watch SE dealsThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 dealsA note on the more premium models\n\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 11, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or 5 behind.\n\nThat being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.\n\nNow, let’s get to the deals.\n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.\n\nWhile the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the Series 9. That being said, it’s currently on sale at Amazon and Walmart right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329 ($70 off), which remains its second-best price to date. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Walmart starting at $359 ($70 off) — which is also the second-best price we’ve seen on the larger configuration — while the LTE models can be had at Amazon and Walmart starting at $429 ($70 off).\n\nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\n\n\n\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\n\nThe Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration).\n\nRight now, the best deal on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found at Amazon and Walmart, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS for $189 ($60 off). The 44mm / GPS configuration, meanwhile, is available at Amazon and Walmart for $219 (also $60 off). If you want the LTE configuration, the 44mm model is currently on sale at Walmart starting at $199 ($130 off), or in the smaller 40mm sizing at Amazon and Walmart starting at $239 ($60 off).\n\nRead our Apple Watch SE (second-gen) review.\n\n\n\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\n\nThe latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.\n\nIn recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazon with a Trail Loop or an Ocean Band starting at $729.99 (about $69 off) or with an Alpine Loop starting at $741.89 (about $57 off).

These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they’re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don’t include them here.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","created":"2025-05-15T18:29:09-04:00","content_encoded":"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-caption=\"The Series 10 is a pretty minor refresh, but the iterative updates over the last-gen Series 9 are welcome.﻿ | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25623076/247270_Apple_watch_series_10_AKrales_0557.jpg?quality=90\u0026#038;strip=all\u0026#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" /\u003e\n\t\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe Series 10 is a pretty minor refresh, but the iterative updates over the last-gen Series 9 are welcome.﻿ | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003eIn September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24246464/apple-watch-series-10-review-smartwatch-wearables\"\u003eApple Watch Series 10\u003c/a\u003e alongside a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248380/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-smartwatch-wearables\"\u003eblack rendition\u003c/a\u003e of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri\"\u003eApple Watch Ultra 2\u003c/a\u003e.

Previously, you needed to use the company’s USB-C dongle receiver.\n\nFirst launched last November, Rode’s $149 Wireless Micro pairs two tiny rechargeable lavalier mics with a wireless receiver that connects directly to mobile devices using their USB-C charging ports (or in the case of older iPhones and iPads, the Lightning port). The receiver can connect to and record from both of the microphones simultaneously using Rode’s mobile app, with a wireless range of 328 feet.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new Direct Connect feature takes that wireless receiver out of the equation so the mics can now connect directly to a smartphone. That approach potentially allows for simpler setups, but it does come with a few compromises. The feature is only compatible with iOS devices — not Android — and audio can only be captured from a single Wireless Micro mic at a time.

In a letter to the FCC spotted by LightReading, Verizon claims the current unlocking requirement “benefits bad actors and fraudsters.”\n\nThe FCC first imposed an unlocking requirement following Verizon’s purchase of C-Block spectrum in 2008. It forced Verizon to allow customers to change to a new cellular carrier after purchasing a phone from the company, making it easier to switch away from than other providers.\n\nAfter some pushback from Verizon, the FCC allowed the carrier to lock phones for 60 days after purchase in 2019. Verizon later extended the policy to TracFone following its acquisition of the prepaid provider in 2021. \n\nBut now, Verizon wants the 60-day period extended even longer, calling the FCC’s current requirement “outdated regulation that has become both burdensome and harmful.”  The company also says eliminating the rule aligns with the FCC’s recent initiative to get rid of “unnecessary” regulations.\n\nIt adds that “recent industry experience shows that even a lock of 60 days does not deter device fraud,” which is why the “industry standard” for providers who don’t have to abide by the 60-day unlocking rule is a minimum of six months.\n\n“Waiving this rule will benefit consumers because it will allow Verizon to continue offering subsidies and other mechanisms to make phones more affordable,” Verizon says. “Waiving the rule also will benefit competition because it will eliminate the distorted playing field that currently exists.”\n\nLast year, the FCC proposed rules that would require all providers, including T-Mobile and AT\u0026T, to unlock phones after 60 days of activation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","created":"2025-05-22T10:37:33-04:00","content_encoded":"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/acastro_STK066_verizon_0003.jpg?quality=90\u0026#038;strip=all\u0026#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" /\u003e\n\t\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003eVerizon has asked the Federal Communications Commission to get rid of the rule requiring it to unlock phones after 60 days.

On Friday, the Federal Communications Commission signed off on the merger, which will allow Verizon to “upgrade and expand” Frontier’s existing fiber networks.\n\nVerizon expects to bring fiber to 1 million homes each year following the acquisition. The deal went through after Verizon “committed to ending DEI-related practices,” according to a statement by FCC Chair Brendan Carr.\n\nThe Intercept reports that in a May 15th letter to Carr, Verizon’s chief legal officer, Vandana Venkatesh, outlined what it’s walking away from. Because “Verizon recognizes that some DEI policies and practices could be associated with discrimination,” it will no longer have any HR roles or teams focused on DEI, remove references to the term from employee training materials, as well as goals for diversity in its supplies, representation of women and minorities in its workforce. In the letter, Venkatesh says that now Verizon’s public messaging is going to “remove references to ‘DEI’ or ‘diversity, equity and inclusion.’”\n\nWhen Verizon’s consumer chief, Sowmyanarayan Sampath, appeared on Decoder last month, we asked him about whether it would fight the FCC imposing regulatory requirements against its diversity initiatives with a decade’s worth of lawsuits, the same way it fought net neutrality. It didn’t.\n\nEarlier this year, Carr criticized Verizon’s “lack of progress” on getting rid of policies related to DEI — or Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion — and suggested that the agency won’t approve deals if companies keep these policies in place. T-Mobile similarly closed its acquisition of the fiber provider Lumos after tweaking mentions of DEI on its website.\n\nThrough the merger, Verizon will also be able to claw back some of its fiber business after it sold parts of its wireline operations, including Fios fiber internet connections, to Frontier in 2015. Carr said the merger will allow fiber to come to more communities, including rural ones. BEAD, a Biden-era initiative, was supposed to pay fiber providers to bring high-speed internet to rural areas, but a report from The Washington Post suggests that the “money isn’t flowing.”\n\n\n\nUpdate, May 16th: Added additional details from Verizon’s letter to the FCC and Decoder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","created":"2025-05-16T13:55:49-04:00","content_encoded":"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/STK066_VERIZON_B.jpg?quality=90\u0026#038;strip=all\u0026#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" /\u003e\n\t\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003eVerizon’s $\u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236519/verizon-frontier-fiber-network-acquisition-20-billion\"\u003e20 billion deal to acquire the fiber internet provider Frontier\u003c/a\u003e is officially happening.

He also made a “peace proposal:” “If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.“\n\nOn May 9th, it submitted the app to Apple. Ahead of that, Sweeney said that Epic would use its Sweden developer account to submit the game to the US App Store. \n\nLate last week, Epic said that Apple had blocked Fortnite’s return to the App Store, and the game also became unavailable on other alternative app stores in the EU. However, Apple said that it had “asked that Epic Sweden resubmit the app update without including the US storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies” and that “we did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces.”\n\nEpic asked the judge in the Epic v. Apple case to order Apple to review its Fortnite submission on May 16th. Yesterday, the judge said in a filing that Apple is “fully capable of resolving this issue without further briefing or a hearing,” and that if a resolution wasn’t reached, the Apple official who “is personally responsible for ensuring compliance” would have to appear at a hearing next Tuesday.\n\nHowever, shortly after Fortnite returned to the App Store on Tuesday, Epic and Apple filed a joint notice saying that they have “resolved all issues” from Epic’s May 16th filing. Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nEpic also recently rolled out a new promotion to encourage players to use its payment systems: if you use Epic’s system in Fortnite, Rocket League, or Fall Guys on PC, iOS, Android, and the web, the company will give you 20 percent back in Epic Rewards that can be used for other purchases in its games or on the Epic Games Store.\n\nIn the iOS version of Fortnite that was released on Tuesday, the app shows you that 20 percent bonus when you pick which payment system you want to use to buy V-Bucks.\n\nThe company launched a new Star Wars-themed season for Fortnite on May 2nd.\n\nIf you get the app from the App Store, it will be a small initial download, and after you actually open the app, it will download the rest of the game. For a colleague, that additional download was 12.95GB.\n\nUpdate, May 20th: Added details of Epic and Apple’s joint notice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","created":"2025-05-20T18:15:54-04:00","content_encoded":"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/vpavic_180607_2652_0075.jpg.webp?quality=90\u0026#038;strip=all\u0026#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" /\u003e\n\t\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortnite\u003c/em\u003e is once again available on the iOS App Store in the US, \u003ca href=\"https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1924949632628523199\"\u003eaccording to Epic Games\u003c/a\u003e.

The announcements come as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang joined President Trump in Saudi Arabia this week to solicit AI investments for US companies.\n\nThe US Department of Commerce (DOC) announced on Monday that it has rescinded the Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule, due to take effect on May 15th, that aimed to restrict how many US-made AI chips could be sent to international markets without special government approval. The DOC said that a replacement rule for protecting US AI technology will be issued “in the future,” but provided no specific details.\n\n“These new requirements would have stifled American innovation and saddled companies with burdensome new regulatory requirements,” The DOC said in a statement. “The AI Diffusion Rule also would have undermined US diplomatic relations with dozens of countries by downgrading them to second-tier status.”\n\nWhile the goal was to prevent countries already subject to chip restrictions, such as Russia and China, from accessing or building AI tech, it also placed Nvidia’s estimated 90 percent share of the AI chip market in jeopardy. Shortly after the Diffusion Rule was introduced by former President Joe Biden in January, Nvidia issued a statement calling it “misguided,” while anticipating a return to Trump’s first term policies “that strengthen American leadership, bolster our economy and preserve our competitive edge in AI and beyond.”\n\nThe DOC also warned companies that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chipset “anywhere in the world” would violate US export control agreements. Huawei’s home-grown Ascend processors are seen as China’s best answer to Nvidia’s powerful AI chips. \n\nNvidia’s Huang was notably one of the only US tech leaders to not attend Donald Trump’s inauguration. His absence doesn’t appear to have soured the relationship between them, however, with Huang spotted cosying up to Trump at a US-Saudi investment summit in Riyadh on Tuesday, alongside other tech leaders like Elon Musk, AMD’s Lisa Su, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump was far from subtle about what the US wanted from the gathering. “As you know, we have the biggest business leaders in the world here,” he told  Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “They’re going to walk away with a lot of checks for a lot of things that you’re going to provide.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","created":"2025-05-14T06:40:56-04:00","content_encoded":"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"President Donald J.

The students’ visas weren’t canceled, but DHS’s revocation of Harvard’s SEVIS certification could, in theory, make nearly 6,800 international students enrolled at Harvard deportable immediately.\n\n“This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,” DHS secretary Kristi Noem said on Thursday. “It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments. Harvard had plenty of opportunity to do the right thing. It refused.”\n\nA month earlier, DHS demanded that Harvard turn over information on its international students, including their “known illegal activity,” “known dangerous or violent activity,” “known threats to other students or university personnel,” and “known deprivation of rights of other classmates or university personnel.” The department also requested information on any disciplinary action that had been taken against international students who participated in protests. DHS threatened to rescind Harvard’s SEVIS certification if the university didn’t turn over student records by April 30th.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has used allegations of antisemitism at universities across the country to retaliate against students involved in campus protests against the war on Gaza — and against the universities themselves, which the administration claims haven’t done enough to quell antisemitism on their campuses. In addition to pulling billions of dollars in federal funding, the administration has also had Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest several students over their pro-Palestine activism. Some of these students, like Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi, are green card holders whom ICE has accused of engaging in behavior that is contrary to the US’s foreign policy interests. Others are international students whose visas were revoked by the State Department, thus making them deportable.\n\nInstead of targeting individual students at Harvard, the Trump administration is going after the university’s ability to enroll international students altogether. Unlike Columbia, which capitulated to a list of Trump’s demands, Harvard has generally refused to comply with the administration’s requests that it hand over data on its international students; “audit” its academic programs, as well as students’ and faculty’s political views; and change its governance structure and hiring practices.\n\nHarvard sued the administration on Friday. In a complaint filed in Massachusetts federal court, the university’s lawyers called DHS’s revocation of its SEVIS certification a “blatant violation of the First Amendment.”\n\n“It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government’s demands to control Harvard’s governance, curriculum, and the ‘ideology’ of its faculty and students,” the complaint alleges. “With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard’s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission.”\n\nMoreover, the suit claims, revoking Harvard’s SEVIS status puts students in an impossible position. “Termination of SEVIS records presents student visa holders whose school loses its certification with two bad choices,” the complaint claims: transferring immediately, or leaving the country.\n\nA federal judge has temporarily blocked DHS’s attempt to revoke Harvard’s SEVIS certification. The university’s international students are safe — for now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","created":"2025-05-23T15:38:32-04:00","content_encoded":"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/VRG_Illo_STK175_L_Normand_DonaldTrump_Negative.jpg?quality=90\u0026#038;strip=all\u0026#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" /\u003e\n\t\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003ePresident Donald Trump’s administration is trying to strip Harvard of its ability to enroll international students — an effort \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/harvard-foreign-students-enrollment-trump-lawsuit-94b65866c563e67a7a7a3c79e90144d6\"\u003eblocked by a federal judge\u003c/a\u003e on Friday, just hours after the university filed a lawsuit claiming Trump was violating its First Amendment rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-none\"\u003eOn Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/harvard-international-students-trump-sevis.html\"\u003e rescinded Harvard’s access\u003c/a\u003e to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a government database of international students attending universities in the United States.

Now, Android will automatically block users from sideloading an app for the first time from a web browser, messaging app, or other service while on a call with an unknown contact.\n\nGoogle will also stop users from giving an app accessibility permissions while talking on the phone, helping to prevent a potentially dangerous app from gaining control of their device and stealing personal information. If you try to adjust these settings during a call, Google will display a message saying: “This setting is blocked to protect your device.” It also warns users that “scammers may try to take control of your device by asking you to allow accessibility access for an app.”\n\nGoogle already blocks users from disabling its app security service, Play Protect, during phone calls. The company says these protections happen “completely on device” and should help prevent scammers from tricking users into downloading malicious apps and enabling sensitive permissions. The new protections are available on devices with Android 16.\n\nGoogle also announced that it’s testing a new Android feature to discourage users from opening their banking app while sharing their screen on a call. The feature, which is rolling out to banking apps in the UK, including Monzo, NatWest, and Revolut to start, is meant to combat screen-sharing scams where fraudsters impersonate banks or government agencies to convince victims to perform harmful actions, like bank transfers.\n\nWhen users try to launch a banking app while sharing their screen with an unknown contact, Google will display a pop-up to warn of a “likely scam,” while offering an “end call” button that users can press to immediately hang up and stop sharing their screen. If users choose not to end the call, they’ll have to wait 30 seconds before they can continue to share their banking app’s screen. This will be available to devices running Android 11 and newer, and Google says it will “assess the results of the pilot” before rolling it out more widely.\n\nThese features build upon Android’s growing scam protection tools.

One person posted a video of a cat in a sink reacting to droplets from a faucet. New York Times tech reporter Mike Isaac tagged Grok and asked “is this true.” Here is Grok’s reply:\n\n\nThe claim of white genocide in South Africa is highly contentious and lacks credible evidence. Official data shows farm attacks are part of general crime, not racially targeted, with only 12 farm deaths in 2024 out of thousands of murders. A 2025 court ruling dismissed the claim as “not real.” While some cite “Kill the Boer” as evidence, courts have ruled it protected speech, not hate. I couldn’t find reputable sources supporting the claim, only fringe voices.

Digital Foundry gets more specific: it says the Switch 2’s custom Nvidia T239 system-on-a-chip uses an ARM Cortex A78C CPU with eight cores.

Most of us probably won’t be able to afford the helpful sentient humanoids being developed in our lifetimes, but robot vacuums are an affordable way to experience that promised utopia right now.\n\nToday’s floor cleaners are also more advanced than ever. In addition to vacuuming, many of the best models can now mop, allowing you to tackle both carpet and hardwood flooring. Some can automatically dispense of their trash and dirty water, too, and clean their own components without intervention. Soon, we’ll even have models that can pick up dirty laundry and purify the air in your home, preventing you from having to lift a finger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Roborock dealsThe best Dreame dealsThe best SwitchBot dealsThe best Eufy dealsThe best Yeedi dealsThe best Shark dealsOther robot vacuum deals\n\n\nBut if you need something relatively affordable for daily cleaning, you’d be surprised how little you have to pay for premium features. Below, we’ve listed the best deals currently available on a slate of Verge-approved robot vacuums, whether you prefer a budget entry-level model from Yeedi or a top-of-the-line offering from iRobot, Dreame, and more.\n\nThe best Roborock deals\n\nRoborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra — our pick for the best robot vacuum overall — is available from Best Buy, Roborock, and Amazon for $1,299.99 ($500 off), which is $200 shy of its best price to date. The combination of a 10,000Pa suction power and dual rubber roller brushes makes it a terrific vacuum, one that can easily pick up pet hair and other debris. It can also mop with great efficiency thanks to a sonic mopping system that vibrates the mop pad 4,000 times a minute, allowing it to clean sticky juices, thick condiments, and other common spills. The mop arm can extend to cover corners and baseboard edges, too.\n\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra’s camera-equipped AI obstacle avoidance makes it the best navigator in Roborock’s lineup and one of the top models overall, though it’s not quite as strong as Roomba’s. The mobile app offers ample options to customize cleaning zones and schedules, and you can use its dedicated voice assistant to start and stop routines. It’s also a Matter-ready robot that’s compatible with Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home.\n\nThe Roborock S8 Plus is another great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that’s available for $519.99 ($480 off) — its second-best price to date — from Walmart and Roborock. It offers a vibrating mop pad that scrubs floors well, and, like the S8 MaxV Ultra, it features dual rubber roller brushes. It’s not as powerful as the MaxV Ultra given its 6,000Pa of suction, but it still does a good job of sucking up dirt from carpets. It also lacks a water tank, though you do get good obstacle detection and a smaller auto-empty dock that saves space.\n\nThe best Dreame deals\n\nThe Dreame X40 Ultra is another mopping robot, and while it’s on the more expensive side, you can currently pick it up for $999.99 ($500 off) — $100 shy of its all-time low — from Dreame and Amazon. You’re paying a premium for 12,000Pa of suction power and a pair of removable, self-retracting mop pads, which it can automatically clean and dry on its own using the included base. It can also empty its own bin and refill its own water tank.\n\nThe Dreame X40 Ultra features an extendable side brush and mop pads, too, offering better coverage for baseboards, corners, and the underside of your furniture. It uses a combination of AI-powered cameras and “3D-structured light” (presumably based on lidar technology) to map and navigate rooms, with customizable keep-out zones and more functions available in the app. There’s also a dirt detection system that can identify messier spills and adjust its cleaning routine accordingly.\n\nThe Dream L20 Ultra is available for an all-time low of $549.98 ($450 off) at Amazon. The L20 Ultra is an excellent alternative to Dreame’s newer flagship robots, including the X40. It lacks a bit of power in comparison, though its 7,000Pa of suction power is still enough for most cleaning jobs. It also doesn’t have the L40’s tri-cut brush, which makes the step-up model more efficient at picking up pet hair. The only other real advantage the X40 holds over the L20 is its self-extending arms for vacuuming (though the dual mop pads can extend a bit for baseboard and corner coverage), nor does it have dirt detection.\n\nThe L20 Ultra’s base station is rather large, but it can take care of the entire cleaning process, including emptying the dustbin, emptying and refilling the water tanks, and washing and drying the mop pads. It doesn’t have a heated cleaning function for the mop pads, however. It uses a lidar-based AI-powered navigation system, and you can prompt it to start cleaning by voice using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.\n\nThe best SwitchBot deals\n\nThe SwitchBot S10 is available with a free water tank for $459.99 ($740 off) — $69 shy of its all-time low — when you check out via Roborock’s online storefront with promo code MDYLOM. The S10 is one of the most affordable robot vacuum / mop hybrids you can buy, one that can refill its own tank so long as you hook the battery-powered base station into your home’s plumbing. It can also dry its own mop pads and empty its own bin at a separate docking bay, and offers enough capacity to run for up to 90 days without intervention.\n\nThe S10’s self-cleaning roller mop is more effective than the typical pads we see in most other units, but it’s also limited to a smaller coverage area. It only has a single roller brush for vacuuming, but its respectable 6,500Pa suction can make up for it. And while it has lidar mapping and AI-powered obstacle avoidance, we found it still has a tendency to get stuck on laundry, bath mats, and other obstacles. The S10 is also one of the few robovacs with Matter support, however, which effectively enables native control through Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa (though said platforms don’t yet fully support robot vacuums).\n\nRead our SwitchBot S10 review.\n\nThe SwitchBot K10 Plus is also available for an all-time low of $199.99 ($200 off) directly from SwitchBot with promo code LMTM120. At 3.6 inches high and 9.8 inches wide, it’s a more petite option if you want something that can maneuver tighter spaces, which it does to decent success with a lidar-based mapping system that supports digital keep-out zones. It only has 2,500Pa suction, but that should be powerful enough to lift dirt in all but the deepest carpeting. You can also attach disposable mopping pads, though their mopping function doesn’t work well. The K10 Plus comes with a self-emptying dock that can hold a respectable four liters of dirt before it needs emptying.\n\nThe best Eufy deals\n\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni, our current pick for the best midrange robot vacuum / mop, is now available at Amazon for $699.99 ($100 off), which is about $150 shy of the all-time low we last saw during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. You can also grab it directly from Eufy for the same price when you use promo code WS24T2351121 at checkout.\n\nThe X10 Pro Omni is a bit of a novelty, at least in comparison to other robovacs in its price range, in that it offers AI-powered obstacle detection, which allows it to deftly navigate cables and other clutter. It also features a slew of functions you’d expect from top-of-the-line models, including 8,000Pa of suction power, speedy lidar-powered mapping, and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping.\n\nMind you, none of these features are as effective as they are on more premium models, though the result is an all-in-one bot that punches above its weight. Plus, it has heated mop drying and onboard water reservoir, the latter of which prevents it from having to return to its multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill dock too frequently.\n\nIf you’re looking for a bump-and-roll model that’s relatively budget-friendly, the Eufy 11S Max is on sale at Amazon for just $159.99 ($90 off). The 11S Max stands out from other robovacs because it doesn’t use Wi-Fi, meaning it doesn’t require you to fiddle with a mobile app on your phone. Instead, you can control it using an on-board button or with the included remote, which also allows you to create cleaning schedules. It’s relatively quiet and reliable, too, with 2,000Pa of suction power and replaceable parts, making it a great long-term investment for those who want something basic.\n\nThe best Yeedi deals\n\nThe Yeedi Cube is currently down to an all-time low of $246.99 ($243 off) at Amazon for Prime members. It’s not easy to find a self-emptying / self-cleaning vacuum at this price, as those features are typically only available on robots that cost upward of $600 or more.\n\nWith 5,100Pa of suction power, the Cube can tackle most common vacuuming scenarios, though its single hybrid rubber / bristle brush can get easily tangled with pet hair. It mops better than most models in its range, however, namely because its vibrating microfiber pads can actually scrub your floors. The Cube uses lasers for object avoidance, too, though it’s not as effective for navigation as those with lidar and AI smarts. It can avoid large furniture and other objects, but it might need your help rerouting around cables, toys, and laundry. Still, we found it navigates better than most other robots under $300.\n\nThe best Shark deals\n\nThe Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 is a great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that’s now on sale for an all-time low of $379.99 ($320 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and directly from Shark. Before the Eufy X10 Pro Omni took its place, the Matrix Plus 2-in-1 was our runner-up pick for those seeking a midrange robot vacuum that mops and automatically empties its own bin. Its vibrating, sonic mopping feature does an excellent job of scrubbing hardwood floors; however, keep in mind that you’ll have to fill and attach the mop reservoir manually.\n\n\n\nOther robot vacuum deals\n\nUpdate, May 13th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and several new deals, including one for the Deebot X8 Pro Omni.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","created":"2025-05-13T18:46:37-04:00","content_encoded":"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-caption=\"A number of excellent models are on sale right now, including the SwitchBot S10. | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25426542/8A0A1239.jpeg?quality=90\u0026#038;strip=all\u0026#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" /\u003e\n\t\u003cfigcaption\u003eA number of excellent models are on sale right now, including the SwitchBot S10. | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re in an age where you can realistically delegate tasks to smart hunks of metal, whether it’s a self-driving car or a robot that can clean on your behalf.
