The 4-inch, self-inflating mattress is a favorite of ours for camping thanks to its extra-wide design,&nbsp;along with its open-cell polyurethane foam and generous padding, the latter of which is designed to keep you warm and comfortable when temperatures begin to dip. It also makes for a great air mattress for guests, regardless of where you put it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Half Dome 2 Tent</strong> is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/product/243702/rei-co-op-half-dome-2-tent-with-footprint\">REI</a> with a footprint for $209.29 ($90 off), which is one of the best prices we’ve seen on the REI-branded tent.

All eight seasons will move over from Netflix, which has hosted the absurdly popular kids show since 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>CoComelon,</em> essentially a series of mind-numbingly plotless, CG-animated vignettes set to karaoke-quality nursery rhymes, is a giant in the world of programming for children, having accounted for 601 million Netflix views in 2023. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, it was the second most-streamed show on the platform last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite its popularity, Bloomberg reports that <em>CoComelon</em> views fell by “almost 60% over the last couple of years,” and that compared to all of streaming, it went from the fifth most-watched show in 2023 to not even breaking the top 10 last year. Still, it’s probably going to be a good deal for Disney, which will reportedly pay “tens of millions” a year for it.
